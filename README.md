## ❯ What is this and who is it for 🤷‍♀️

HandyPark is a parking management app designed for car parking companies to manage and sell spaces online.
It overlays custom price markers for each parking location using the [google-map-react](https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react) library. This project was completed in one week. The purpose was was to get more experience with React, Material-UI and styled components.
